## Description
C Graphical Programing my_runner Epitech Teck1

In this project, you are asked to make a small video game based on the rules of a finite Endless Running
Game.

The basic rules for the my_runner are as follows:  
• the player is a character who runs in a map you took as parameter.  
• enemies and obstacles must appear on the opposite side to the player position.  
• the player can use the space bar to jump and avoid obstacles and enemies.  
• as the player runs, a score, which will be displayed, will increase.  
• when the player dies or finishes the map, the score is displayed inside the window.

As you previously did, being able to manage inputs from the user and to display animated sprites are key
skills when you want to develop basic games. Furthermore, you will need to manage various new game
making skills such as:  
• reading a file describing an environnement and use it to render a visual.  
• manage basic game physics.  
• manage multiple entities at the same time.

#### Usage
    ./my_runner map.txt

## Result
100% moulinette Epitech
